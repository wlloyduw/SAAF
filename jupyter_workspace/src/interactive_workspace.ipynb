    "Welcome to the SAAF Jupyter notebook! This default notebook provides comments to guide you through all of the main features. If you run into errors or probls please make sure you have the AWS CLI properly configure so that you can deploy function with it, have Docker installed and running, gave execute permission to everything in the /jupyter_workspace and /test directory, and finally installed all the dependencies. You can use quickInstall.sh in the root folder to walk you through the setup process and install dependencies. This notebook is designed to be ran locally or on EC2 instances and works very will with Visual Studio Code's Jupyeter plugin. Other environments may work but getting this notebook to work on cloud based platforms like Google Collab may be very difficult.\n",

In this cell we define our config object, this object contains any information that we need to deploy functions, such as a role for functions on AWS Lambda. If all of your functions will use the same config object, you can set it globally by using setGlobalConfig. Any methods that take a config object will priorize the object passed to them over the global config.\n",

After running, see src/handler_jello_world.py for the automatically generated source code.\n",

By default, RunMode.CLOUD is used and calling cloud functions will run them on the cloud. RunMode.LOCAL makes it so that cloud functions are executed locally when called on their own, so to run them on the cloud you must use the test method. As you can see here, we have one single function but like in the previous example we can see different CPUs depending on if it is ran locally or on the cloud using the test method. But, since hello_world is still a cloud function with the default RunMode.CLOUD, it will be called on the cloud instead of running locally. Finally, if you don't want your functions running locally or on the cloud but instead just deployed when the cell is ran you can use RunMode.NONE."

    "Now, what's cooler than running a function on the cloud once? Running it multiple times! The run_experiment function allows you to create complex FaaS experiments. This function uses our FaaS Runner application to execute functions behind the scenes. It's primary purpose is to run multiple function requests across many threads. You define payloads in the payloads list, choose your memory setting (it will switch settings automatically) and define how many runs you want to do, across how many threads, and how many times you want to repeat the test with iterations. These are the most important parameters, but there are many more defined in the link below. \n",
